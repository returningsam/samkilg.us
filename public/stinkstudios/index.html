        <p>In no way do I consider myself a designer - graphic, visual, experience, or otherwise. I am a Computer Science major at Rochester Institute of Technology, however I would absolutely consider myself a creative. I find that upon hearing this, people scoff and say that Computer Science is not and cannot be an art form. I highly disagree. I constantly think out of the dodecahedron and create something more than just software. I have been working for the past few years of my life to learn and practice skills that will help me create things with code that no one, including myself, could ever imagine. I have explored harnessing the power of entropy to create infinite galleries of “art” that is only made possible with the help of code.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, I have not yet been able to explore these passions in a professional environment. I crave any and all opportunities available to work with other incredible creatives to foster the future of art and design, especially through emerging technologies. After exploring the work done by Stink Studios, I am convinced that I can both learn a great deal from and contribute a great deal to the development team. I believe that I would be an asset if given the chance to work with such an amazing group of individuals.</p>
